This is a WordPress plugin for creating location post types and displaying them using Google Maps. It is a work in progress, 
and is meant to be a simple starting point for a custom Google Maps plugin, instead of relying on complicated third party solutions.

To use this plugin as is, you will need to edit the PHP files and insert your Google Maps API key. Use find to search $GOOGLEKEY and
enter your key there.

Features so far:

* Create custom post type named Location: Includes extra fields for address, phone, latitude, longitude, short description, and active listing toggle
    
* Automatic latitude and longitude: Fill address field and click Latitude or Longitude label for automatic GPS lookup and filling fields with values
    
* Example template for displaying a Google Map: Displays interactive map with the Google Maps API populated by a category of the location custom post type, includes sample style customization
